## How it works

The EA executes its trading logic within the `OnTick()` function. It first checks if there is a new bar by calling the `NewBar()` function. If there is a new bar, it proceeds to analyze the CHOCH price and market trends by calling the `CalculateCHOCH()` and `IsUptrend()` functions respectively.

If the CHOCH price is greater than 0 and an uptrend is detected, the EA calculates the lot size based on the risk percentage by calling the `CalculateLotSize()` function. It then places a buy stop order and a sell stop order using the calculated lot size, stop loss and take profit levels.

The `CalculateCHOCH()`, `NewBar()`, `IsUptrend()`, and `CalculateLotSize()` functions contain placeholder code and need to be implemented according to the specific trading strategy.
